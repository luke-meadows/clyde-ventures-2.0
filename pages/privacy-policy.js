          Your Rights as A Data Subject?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          You have the right to lodge a complaint directly with the supervisory
          authority, the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office (ICO)
          (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal
          with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in
          the first instance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          You have other rights under data protection law that you can exercise
          in relation to your personal data which we hold but these do not apply
          in all circumstances. You can exercise those rights free of charge
          except in very limited circumstances, which will be explained to you
          if relevant, including where we may charge a reasonable fee if your
          request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively,
          we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          When exercising these rights, we may ask you for proof of your
          identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is
          not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may
          also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to
          your request to speed up our response.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
          Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
          particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
          case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          For more information about all these rights, and how to exercise them,
          please contact us and we will be happy to discuss these with you.

        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Here are short descriptions of your rights:
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Right of access &#8209; you have a right to request a copy of the
          personal data we hold about you, to obtain confirmation that it is
          being processed, and to obtain certain prescribed information about
          how it is processed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Right of rectification (correction) &#8209; in certain circumstances
          you have a right to ask for your personal data to be corrected if it
          is inaccurate, and completed if it is incomplete, although we may need
          to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Where your
          personal data in question has been disclosed to third party
          organisations, they must be informed of the rectification, if
          possible.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Right to request erasure (sometimes referred to as the “right to be
          forgotten”) &#8209; in certain circumstances, you can ask to have your
          personal data deleted or erased: where there is no reason for us to
          continue to process it; where you have successfully exercised your
          right to object to processing (see more below); where we may have
          processed your information unlawfully; or where we are required to
          erase your personal data to comply with local law. It is unlikely to
          be possible to accept your request for erasure for certain specific
          legal reasons, including if, for example, Clyde Ventures has a duty to
          retain or process your information. Any such reasons will be notified
          to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Right to restriction of processing &#8209; if certain conditions
          apply, you have a right to restrict the processing of your
          information. This includes when you contest it as being inaccurate
          (until the accuracy is proved); if you have objected to the processing
          (when it was necessary for legitimate interests) and Clyde Ventures is
          considering whether its legitimate interests override your own; where
          our use of the personal data is unlawful but you do not want Clyde
          Ventures to erase it; or if Clyde Ventures no longer need the personal
          data for the purposes we held it but you require us to continue to
          hold it to establish, make or defend legal claims.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Right of portability &#8209; in certain circumstances, you have the
          right to request the transfer of your personal data to a third party
          or to yourself. This right is only relevant if personal data is being
          processed based on a consent (or for performance of a contract) and is
          done automatically. This right is different from the right of access
          (see above). We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
          your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
          format.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Right to object &#8209; in certain circumstances, you have the right
          to object to certain types of processing of your personal data when
          our processing is based on legitimate interests and there is something
          about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to
          processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
          rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object to processing
          when your personal data is processed for direct marketing (including
          profiling relevant to direct marketing) or when it is processed for
          the purposes of statistics. In some cases, we may demonstrate that
          Clyde Ventures has compelling legitimate grounds to process your
          information which override your rights and freedoms.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-5 mb-5 pt-0 pb-0 break-words">
          Right to withdraw consent &#8209; You can also withdraw consent if you
          have provided it and if this is relied on as the legal basis for Clyde
          Ventures using your personal data &#8209; as previously described.
